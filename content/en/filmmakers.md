## Nelson de Witt / Roberto Coto
{{< image-text src="/images/filmmaker_nelson.jpg" class= "left" >}}


In 1997, Nelson de witt, a 16-year-old adoptee from Boston, Massachusetts, discovered that he had been identified as one Roberto Coto, an infant who disappeared in 1982 after a deadly government raid on three guerrilla safe houses in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

The raid rescued a kidnapped businessman and also resulted in the disappearance of a dozen Salvadoran revolutionaries, including Roberto’s biological mother, Ana Milagro Escobar. Today, a generation after one of the bloodiest conflicts of the Cold War, the wounds of the Civil War in El Salvador are still open and the truth about them has been obscured.

Nelson/Roberto has determined that sharing his search for the truth about his story is his way of making a difference. At the heart of Nelson/Roberto’s search is the simple belief that finding what makes us all alike—or connected—can change the world.

“My favorite explanation about the need to tell stories comes from the historian Wallace Stegner, who wrote, “Any people in a new land may be pardoned for being solicitous about their history; they create it, in a sense, by remembering it.” While Stegner was speaking about 19th Century Mormon Pioneers, I’ve always felt that his words apply equally well to anyone whose truth doesn’t fit neatly into a familiar little box.

I met Nelson as his counselor at a YMCA summer camp in Western Massachusetts. I was trying to keep up with a cabin full of Mighty Midgets before heading off to my first year of college. He was a happy and determined 8-year-old who already was showing his proclivity for being a snappy dresser. One memory that has stuck with me of Nelson the camper is from the Family Visiting Day, when his younger brother Derek grasped around one of Nelson’s fingers and seemed to never let go from the minute he arrived until it was time to leave.

After reconnecting with him on Facebook recently, I started reading Nelson’s blog, Ana’s Miracle, to find out why he now referred to himself by two names, Nelson/Roberto. His blog posts and videos about life with his family revealed an absolute determination to share that story. It’s a story that deals with subjects like war, adoption, family, and identity. It’s a story that recalls events which are larger-than-life and twist in unexpected ways. But most of all, it’s a story about what makes us alike or connected, which is something I began learning about from Nelson and his family a long time ago.”
