## 2010 – Fall

We launched a fundraising campaign via the crowd sourcing website Kickstarter that would allow us to begin telling the story in the form of a documentary. By the last week of our 8 week campaign, we had raised only 30% of our $15,000 goal when something amazing happened: we closed a $9,000 gap to successfully fund the project in six days and with the backing of 170 total supporters!

## 2011 – Spring

Nelson was invited to participate in an historic commemoration of El Salvador’s Day of the Disappeared Children and we decided this event would be a great place to begin our documentary process. During our 10-day trip to El Salvador, we interviewed several members of Nelson’s family and the other disappeared children, met the President of El Salvador, and traveled out to the Department of Chalatenango, the former Conflict Zone, to meet Suyapa Serrano Cruz, a woman who one day will be listed in textbooks about Latin America as a Civil Rights Hero. It was an amazing experience.
